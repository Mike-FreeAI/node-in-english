Respond to GET requests to the root URL with a nicely designed but basic HTML page that says 'Hello, AI world!' and has links to all the endpoints you've created.
Also, mention that all of this was generated by an AI model, and provide a link to the GitHub repository 'vitprajzler/node-in-english' where the code is hosted.
Serve it with the right headers for a browser to understand that it's an HTML page.
